# K-monitor Corruption Detection Project

This project was developed to assist K-monitor in their mission to unveil corruption using technology, research, and participatory action. The project involves complex data cleaning, network analysis, and interactive visualizations to identify and analyze corruption patterns in the Electronic Public Procurement System.

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- To clean and consolidate data errors from manual entries in the Electronic Public Procurement System using vector embeddings and similarity search.
- To construct a bipartite network for large-scale network analysis to detect corruption patterns between buyers and sellers.
- To create advanced interactive visualizations and perform network analysis at the subgraph level.

## Features

### Data Cleaning Script
- **Vector Embeddings**: Uses advanced vector embeddings to represent data entries.
- **Similarity Search**: Implements similarity search to identify and consolidate manual data entry errors.
- **Error Correction**: Automatically corrects common data entry errors, improving data integrity.

### Bipartite Network Construction
- **Network Construction**: Builds a bipartite network representing relationships between buyers and sellers.
- **Large Scale Analysis**: Scalable to handle large datasets and complex network structures.
- **Corruption Pattern Detection**: Identifies potential corruption patterns through network metrics and analysis.

### Interactive Visualizations
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Provides a suite of interactive visualizations to explore the data and network.
- **Subgraph Analysis**: Allows users to drill down into specific subgraphs for detailed analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
